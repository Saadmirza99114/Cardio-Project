# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Description
This project is focused on predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease (CHD) using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to provide insights into the likelihood of CHD in patients.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in `CHD_preprocessed.csv`. It contains various features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Data Preprocessing
We have performed data preprocessing to clean the dataset by removing missing values and standardizing the features.

## Model Training
We used logistic regression and a random forest classifier to build predictive models for CHD risk.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Jaccard similarity score and accuracy. Confusion matrices and classification reports are also provided for detailed analysis.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute to this project, please follow our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions.
